Privacy Policy — AiXelMusicOrchestrator

Last updated: August 10, 2025

AiXelMusicOrchestrator (“the App”) generates MIDI files from musical inputs. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

1) Data We Collect
We do not collect, store, or sell personal data. Musical inputs (e.g., chord progressions, settings) are processed solely to generate the requested MIDI file.

2) Files & Storage
Generated MIDI files are written locally to the path you specify. We do not upload your files to any server.

3) API Keys & Third-Party Services
If you provide an API key within the App, it is used only to perform the requested processing. We do not transmit keys to any third parties beyond the service you explicitly invoke, and we do not retain keys outside your configuration.

4) Logs
Operational logs (if any) are limited to technical events and errors. Logs do not include personal data and are stored locally, not shared.

5) Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly process personal data of children.

6) Your Choices
You control what inputs you provide and where output files are saved. You may delete generated files at any time.

7) Changes
We may update this policy to reflect improvements. The “Last updated” date will change accordingly.

8) Contact
For questions or requests, contact: youremail@example.com.
