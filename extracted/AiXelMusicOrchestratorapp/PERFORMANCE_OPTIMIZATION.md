# AiXel Music Orchestrator - Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document outlines performance optimization strategies for the AiXel Music Orchestrator iOS app to ensure smooth operation across all supported devices.

## Audio Performance Optimization

### AudioKit Configuration

1. **Buffer Size Optimization**
   - Use appropriate buffer sizes for different device capabilities
   - iPhone: 256-512 samples
   - iPad: 512-1024 samples
   - Adjust based on device performance and battery level

2. **Sample Rate Management**
   - Default to 44.1 kHz for optimal compatibility
   - Support 48 kHz for professional use cases
   - Automatically adjust based on device capabilities

3. **Audio Engine Optimization**
   ```swift
   // Optimize audio engine settings
   let audioEngine = AudioEngine()
   audioEngine.settings.bufferLength = .medium
   audioEngine.settings.sampleRate = 44100
   audioEngine.settings.channelCount = 2
   ```

### Instrument Engine Performance

1. **Voice Management**
   - Implement voice stealing for polyphonic instruments
   - Limit maximum simultaneous voices per instrument
   - Use voice pooling to reduce memory allocation

2. **DSP Optimization**
   - Pre-calculate filter coefficients
   - Use lookup tables for expensive mathematical operations
   - Implement SIMD operations where possible

3. **Memory Management**
   - Pre-allocate audio buffers
   - Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
   - Implement lazy loading for instrument samples

## UI Performance Optimization

### SwiftUI Best Practices

1. **View Optimization**
   ```swift
   // Use @StateObject for view models
   @StateObject private var orchestrationManager = OrchestrationManager()
   
   // Minimize view updates with @Published properties
   @Published var currentChord: Chord?
   @Published var isPlaying: Bool = false
   ```

2. **List Performance**
   - Use LazyVStack for large chord progression lists
   - Implement view recycling for mixer controls
   - Minimize complex calculations in view bodies

3. **Animation Performance**
   - Use hardware-accelerated animations
   - Limit concurrent animations
   - Optimize animation curves for 60fps

### Memory Management

1. **Composition Caching**
   - Cache generated compositions in memory
   - Implement LRU cache for recently used compositions
   - Clear cache when memory pressure is detected

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Use appropriate image formats (HEIF for photos, PNG for icons)
   - Implement image caching for instrument icons
   - Use vector graphics where possible

## Python Bridge Optimization

### Execution Performance

1. **Async Processing**
   ```swift
   func generateComposition(parameters: CompositionParameters) async -> Composition {
       return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
           pythonBridge.executeScript(
               script: "generate_composition",
               parameters: parameters
           ) { result in
               continuation.resume(returning: result)
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache Python script compilation results
   - Store frequently used chord progressions
   - Implement progressive loading for large datasets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error recovery
   - Provide fallback compositions for network failures
   - Cache successful results for offline use

## Device-Specific Optimizations

### iPhone Optimization

1. **Screen Size Adaptation**
   - Optimize layout for smaller screens
   - Use compact UI elements
   - Implement gesture-based navigation

2. **Battery Optimization**
   - Reduce background processing
   - Lower audio quality on low battery
   - Implement power-saving mode

### iPad Optimization

1. **Multi-tasking Support**
   - Handle Split View and Slide Over
   - Optimize for external keyboards
   - Support Apple Pencil interactions

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Utilize larger screen real estate
   - Implement advanced mixer layouts
   - Support multiple composition views

## Memory Usage Guidelines

### Target Memory Usage

- **iPhone (4GB RAM)**: Maximum 200MB
- **iPhone (6GB+ RAM)**: Maximum 300MB
- **iPad (4GB RAM)**: Maximum 400MB
- **iPad (8GB+ RAM)**: Maximum 600MB

### Memory Monitoring

```swift
func monitorMemoryUsage() {
    let memoryUsage = getMemoryUsage()
    if memoryUsage > memoryThreshold {
        clearCaches()
        releaseUnusedResources()
    }
}

func getMemoryUsage() -> UInt64 {
    var info = mach_task_basic_info()
    var count = mach_msg_type_number_t(MemoryLayout<mach_task_basic_info>.size)/4
    
    let kerr: kern_return_t = withUnsafeMutablePointer(to: &info) {
        $0.withMemoryRebound(to: integer_t.self, capacity: 1) {
            task_info(mach_task_self_,
                     task_flavor_t(MACH_TASK_BASIC_INFO),
                     $0,
                     &count)
        }
    }
    
    return kerr == KERN_SUCCESS ? info.resident_size : 0
}
```
